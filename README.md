# 42-push_swap

This is a 42 project. This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of 
instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

### 1 - First things first, you need to clone this repository: 

    git clone https://github.com/richardmarcela/42-push_swap.git
  
### 2 - Go to 42-push_swap and run <b>make</b>

    cd 42-push_swap/
    make
        
### 3 - Run push_swap with a bunch of integers numbers:
    
    ./push_swap <number> <number> <number>...

and that's basically it! :)
