This is a 42 project. Sort a stack of integer numbers using the minimum number of instructions.

### 1 - First things first, you need to clone this repository: 

    git clone https://github.com/richardmarcela/42-push_swap.git
  
### 2 - Go to Push_Swap and run <b>make</b>

    cd 42-push_swap/
    make
        
### 3 - Run ./push_swap and include the numbers you want to order. 
    
    ./push_swap <nbr1> <nbr2> <nbr3> <nbr4>...

and that's basically it! :)
